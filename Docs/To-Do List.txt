42 Chore List

Sync initial time when EXTERNAL_TIME is active.  Ref git issue #33.

Implement SPLINE orbit for CENTRAL?

Two-sigma low atmo as well as two-sigma high.  Turn if-else-if ladder into table lookup.

Learn how to get modal integrals from NASTRAN/FEMAP.

Covariance analysis for prox ops, cometary ops, maybe attitude slews?

Fine formation control via wavefront sensing.

Redo POV: Track any point fixed in S/C, not just cm.

KNOWN BUG:  The first body of the first S/C, the first material stomps over any other materials.  This is somehow caused by Geom not being properly initialized.  Subsequent Geom's are fine.  For UVIS, I kludged a fix by making Geom[0] a "sacrificial cube".  Find a better way.

Draw Ground stations in Cam.

Thruster plume model.  Pressure and visualization.

Geometrical optics.  Wavefront shape through multiple reflections (and 
lenses?).

Import from compressed image files (jpg rather than ppm)

Instrument FOV view.  Use for docking camera as well as instruments.

Migrate ST and CSS windows from SatCam to 42.

Draw ST and CSS FOVs based on SC_ files in addition to Inp_FOV list.

Finish implementing commands in Prototype.rtf

Atmospheric Scattering
Procedural clouds based on gyres?

SPH Slosh?

Parallelize shadow volumes for aero/SRP?  Implement in shader?
